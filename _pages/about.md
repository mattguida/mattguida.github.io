🏫 I am a first-year PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne, in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Systems.

🔬 Currently investigating automatic venues of frame detection in news coverage of contemporary polarizing issues,
supervised by [Prof. Lea Frermann](https://www.frermann.de/), [Prof. Ed Hovy](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/887453-eduard-hovy) and [Dr. Yulia Otmakhova](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yzaozUUAAAAJ&hl=en).

👨‍💻 Previously, I have completed a Masters in Speech and Language Processing at the University of Konstanz.

📚 My research focuses on investigating automatic methods for detecting framing in news coverage of contemporary polarizing issues. 

📊 I am particularly interested in the analysis of polarisation, fake news, misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, radicalisation — essentially, anything that involves understanding human behavior and societal dynamics through the lens of NLP.
